# Development Documentation

To start the development environment, you need to open **two terminal windows** and run the following commands simultaneously:

## 1. Tailwind CSS Watcher
This command compiles Tailwind CSS in watch mode, so changes to your styles are immediately reflected.

```bash
npm run watch:css
```

## 2. Zola Server
This command starts the Zola development server, allowing you to preview the site locally.

```bash
zola serve
```

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed (for Tailwind CSS)
- **Zola** installed (for the static site generator)
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies before starting the development environment.
